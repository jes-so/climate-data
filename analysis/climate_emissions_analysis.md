# Climate Sentiment and Emissions Analysis

In this exploratory data analysis project, country emissions data and country-wide climate opinion survey data was used
to attempt to determine whether a country's CO2 emissions have an effect upon climate opinion.

The most promising variables that differ strongly between high- and low-emission countries are whether or not citizens
were likely to report that they were well-educated on climate change, and whether citizens were likely to be personally
concerned about climate change. High-emission countries' populations are more likely to have populations that report being
educated on climate change, while low-emission countries' populations are more likely to report being personally concerned 
about its effects.

However, the exploratory analysis is inconclusive. Emissions appear to have minimal predictive power for either of these
variables, or vice versa.

I predicted that there would be a significant disparity between high- and low-emission countries and the percentage of their
populations that agreed that climate change was occurring. However, not only does this disparity not exist, but even the lowest
reported percentage of a country that agrees that climate change is occurring still represents a majority of the country. Other
variables presented a more apparent disparity.

One of the primary challenges of working with country data is the necessarily low number of data points available for analysis.
It would be valuable to reattempt this analysis on data that is further divided into subregions, simply for a larger dataset.
Having such a limited dataset presents problems while attempting to fit the data to a distribution model, and ultimately
presented some very ill-fit data.

Additionally, further research comparing climate sentiment and wealth, e.g. through GDP, may be valuable as this is one of the
most prominent divisions between high- and low-emission countries. Further analyses may also benefit from focusing on climate
education efforts and political movements, such as the presence of climate action movements or petroleum lobbies.
